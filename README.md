# Kip
A programming language based on grammatical cases of Turkish.

This is not meant to be a usable programming language at all, it's purely an experiment on designing a type system that checks grammatical case in argument passing to functions.

The fact that Turkish has a subject-object-verb (SOV) order and vowel harmony, makes this experiment even more unprecedented from a programming language design point of view.

## Installation

Kip uses [TRmorph](https://github.com/coltekin/TRmorph) for morphological analysis of Turkish words. In order to use TRmorph, you need to install [Foma](https://fomafst.github.io/).

Once you install Foma, you can clone and compile TRmorph:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/coltekin/TRmorph
...

$ make
...
```

Once you compile TRmorph, you need to put the finite-state transducer generated by TRmorph in an environment variable:

```
$ export TRMORPH="/Users/<yourusername>/TRmorph/trmorph.fst"
```

Just make sure to put the right path here instead of the filler one above. You can also add this to your `.bash_profile` file if you wish.

Now you're ready to compile and use Kip. You will need [Stack](http://www.haskellstack.org) for that. Once you install, you can just clone this repo and run inside:

```
$ stack install
```

Now you will have an executable `kip` you can run.
